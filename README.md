**Problem Statement:**
	How might we inform building managers and engineers about asset status,  potential faults, and scheduled tasks as an automated summary report via a voice assistant.
 



**Solution:**
   An AI powered voice assistant would read a daily summary report and provide updates of the day. An engineer would receive information/status update of any asset in the building on interactions with the Q&A voice assistant. The capabilities of the bot can be extended to visualizing sensor data, using push notifications to alert for any asset failure thus contributing to efficient resource planning. 




**Features:**

   - Easy access to real-time building data using voice commands thus saving a lot of time
   - Avoid repetitive manual tasks and spend more time on important task
   - Easier to assess the construction site and monitor the status of the systems using mobile app dashboard (future scope)
   - Mitigate future risks and improve workplace safety through predictive maintenance and forecasting



**Installation Steps**
